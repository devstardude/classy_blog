### 👨‍💻 Why I Made This App
---
I saw many Blog post apps during my hunt for a Beginner Blogpost Project, but none of them had the same stack or features that I wanted in a Blog app.
So I just put together this app by applying my previous knowledge in Node, Express, Ejs, Mongodb, Authentication, and Validation, then I merged my New knowledge of Markdown...Making an Advanced Blogpost making application.
